###Instructions to setup tree_retrieval app docker. 

**1.** Download the directory named *tree_retrieval*.

**2.** Go to the *tree_retrieval* directory and run the following command:

``
docker build -t tree_retrieval:v0.0.1 .
``

**3.** Check whether the docker image *tree_retrieval* has been built by listing all containers:

``
docker images

``

**4.** Run the docker image by mapping exposed docker port 80 to internal service port 5052 by using the following command. If port 80 is already in use by another app, then just replace the port number 80 with another port number.

``
docker run -p 80:5052 tree_retrieval:v0.0.1
``

**5.** Now test the service using the following command:
``
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5052/phylotastic_ws/gt/ot/tree" -H "content-type:application/json" -d '{"taxa": ["Setophaga striata","Setophaga magnolia","Setophaga angelae","Setophaga plumbea","Setophaga virens"]}'
``


After building, you can push to docker hub

docker tag datelife bomeara/datelife

docker login

docker push bomeara/datelife

and then other machines can download it as is to run:

docker pull bomeara/datelife

And run it as

docker run -t -i -p 80:3838 bomeara/datelife

Now, go to http://localhost on any browser to watch the server running

Doing

docker run -t -i -p 80:3838 bomeara/datelife sh -c '/bin/bash'

Will log you into the server so you can look around (i.e., in the /srv dir).

Once you've finished looking around, just type exit and you will be logged out.

You can run multiple instances using

docker-compose up -d --scale datelife=10 for ten instances
