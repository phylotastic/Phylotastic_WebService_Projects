# This script reads the sitemap.xml file from TreeBASE (which contains a full list
# of all publicly reachable studies in the database) and extracts for each link
# in the site map the study ID (an integer). For each ID for which no corresponding
# URL file has been written it then creates on containing the PhyloWS location that
# returns NeXML. (A URL file is a simple text file with a URL in it. The extension
# .url makes it so that this is a clickable link under OSX.) As this script only
# creates files for IDs that have not been seen yet it can be used incrementally, 
# e.g. by running the 'make purls' target.
